Session Summary | Cycle 33 

1. End-to-End Azure Data Engineering Architecture

The session focused on building a complete end-to-end data pipeline using Azure services.

Emphasis was on designing a single parent pipeline that orchestrates the entire flow:

Source systems (REST API / on-prem / SQL)

Bronze layer (raw data in ADLS Gen2)

Silver layer (cleaned & transformed data)

Gold layer (business-ready data with SCD logic)

Final consumption via Azure SQL Database and Power BI

Participants were guided to think in terms of real-time enterprise architecture, not isolated activities.

2. Bronze Layer Design (Raw Data Ingestion)

Bronze layer acts as the system of record and stores data as received.

Data ingestion covered:

REST API ingestion using ADF Copy Activity

Parameterized REST datasets (Base URL + Relative URL)

Avoiding hardcoded endpoints

ForEach loop usage:

Array parameters used to dynamically ingest multiple endpoints or tables

Copy Activity placed inside ForEach for scalability

Bronze data should be retained long-term for auditing and reprocessing.

3. Dynamic Folder and File Management in ADLS Gen2

A key challenge discussed was how pipelines identify data when file names are random.

Solution implemented:

Pass table name as a parameter to the sink

Create one folder per table

Store Parquet files inside table-specific folders

This approach enables:

Clean separation of datasets

Easier downstream processing

Scalable and maintainable pipelines

4. Silver Layer Transformation Strategy

Silver layer is used for data cleansing, standardization, and validation.

Key transformation rules:

Validate NOT NULL only on primary key columns

Do not apply NOT NULL checks on all columns (performance and business realism)

Duplicate handling:

Window transformation preferred over Aggregate

Use partitioning on primary key and ordering by date/timestamp

Silver data is temporary:

Should be refreshed daily

Should not be permanently stored or duplicated unnecessarily

5. Cost Optimization and Data Duplication Control

Avoid storing the same dataset in multiple locations without business need.

Specifically:

Do not store Silver data in both ADLS and Azure SQL

Azure SQL should only contain final Gold/SCD outputs

Emphasis on cost-aware architecture, reflecting real-world cloud projects.

6. Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) Implementation

SCD concepts were applied practically:

SCD Type 1: overwrite old data

SCD Type 2: maintain historical records with effective dates

Project scope:

Implement SCD Type 1 for one table

Implement SCD Type 2 for one table

Only SCD tables are loaded into Azure SQL Database as final outputs.

7. Pipeline Orchestration Using Execute Pipeline

Instead of using multiple triggers, Execute Pipeline activity was introduced.

Benefits:

Clear parent–child pipeline relationship

Better dependency control

Easier monitoring and troubleshooting

Wait on Completion explained:

Ensures downstream pipelines execute only after upstream success

Prevents Gold layer failures due to incomplete Silver processing

Result: a true enterprise-grade orchestration model

8. Performance Optimization – Copy Activity

Performance tuning discussed for large datasets (>1 million rows):

Increase Data Integration Units (DIU)

Increase Degree of Copy Parallelism

Logging considerations:

Disable detailed logging to avoid performance degradation

Staging:

Use selectively based on source–target scenario

Key takeaway:

Do not over-optimize for small datasets

Scale performance settings based on data volume

9. Performance Optimization – Data Flows

Data Flow settings reviewed in detail:

Logging level: Basic or None (avoid Verbose)

Compute size: Small / Medium / Large based on data volume

Compute type: General vs Memory Optimized

Retry policy:

Configure retry count and retry interval

Helps handle transient network or runtime failures automatically

Emphasis on production-grade stability and scalability

10. Documentation and Review Expectations

Documentation should explain architecture and flow, not tool-level clicks.

Recommended structure:

Architecture overview

Bronze → Silver → Gold flow

Parameterization strategy

Performance tuning decisions

Screenshots where needed

All documentation must be completed and shared before the scheduled review.

Review will focus on concept clarity, design decisions, and real-world readiness.
